# 4156-Miniproject-2025-Students
This is the public repo for posting the miniproject assignments to the class COMS 4156 Advanced Software Engineering at Columbia University. It was originally forked from: https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/4156-Miniproject-2025-Students

This is a RESTful API service for managing a book lending system.

## Building and Running a Local Instance
In order to build and use this service you must install the following:

1. **Maven 3.9.11+**: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  - Download and follow the installation instructions
  - Make sure to add Maven's bin directory to your PATH environment variable

2. **JDK 21**: This project uses JDK 21 for development
  - Download from: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21

3. **IntelliJ IDE**: We recommend IntelliJ but you can use any IDE
  - Download from: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

4. **Cloning repo**: Open terminal and copy these commands. At the top of this GitHub page, click the green code button and copy the http line into the <repository-url> placeholder:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd 4156-Miniproject-2025-Students/IndividualProject
```

5. **Building the application**: Run these commands in your terminal
```
mvn clean compile
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Running Tests
Unit tests are located under the `/IndividualProject/src/test` directory.

To run all tests and generate coverage report:
```
mvn clean test
mvn test jacoco:report
```

Coverage reports will be generated in `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

## Checkstyle
To run the style checker, use `mvn checkstyle:check` or `mvn checkstyle:checkstyle` if you want to generate a report as well.

## Static Analysis
I used PMD, a built-in Maven, plugin, to perform static analysis (bugs and code styling). If you fork the repo, this code is already included in pom.xml but to use PMD in general make sure to include this code. 

It implements the JXR plugin in pom.xml, a stylistic tool that lets you visualize your code in HTML better, which is helpful for reading the reports.
```	<reporting>
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jxr-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.0</version>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
```
To generate a pmd report, run in terminal:
```mvn pmd:pmd```

Reports are generated in `target/site/pmd.html`


## Continuous Integration
This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline automatically:
- Builds the project
- Runs all unit tests
- Performs code style checking with Checkstyle
- Runs static analysis with PMD
